# Tkinter Widgets (Basics)

**Introduction** : Tkinter is Pythonâ€™s standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. tkinter we can use to build out interfaces â€“ such as buttons, menus, interfaces, and various kind of entry fields and display areas. We call these elements Widgets.

**Widgets** : In Tkinter, a widget is essentially a graphical component that the user can interact with. They can range from simple elements like buttons and labels to more complex ones like text entry fields, listboxes, and canvases. Each widget serves a specific purpose and can be customized to fit the design and functionality requirements of your application.

## Working of Widgets

Each widget in Tkinter is an instance of a specific class defined in the Tkinter Module. These classes provide methods and attributes that allow you to configure the widgetâ€™s appearance, behavior, and functionality. Widgets are typically added to the applicationâ€™s window or frames using layout managers like pack(), grid(), or place(), which determine their position and size within the interface.
