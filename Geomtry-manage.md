# ðŸš€ Tkinter Geometry Management

Efficiently managing the geometry of Tkinter windows and widgets is essential for creating polished user interfaces. In this section, weâ€™ll cover everything from setting window dimensions to handling resizing, padding, and widget positioning. 

Weâ€™ll explore methods like place(), grid(), and pack() to help you create organized and responsive layouts. Additionally, weâ€™ll delve into advanced techniques like the PanedWindow widget.

## General Usable Methods

- **place()** : Used for providing specific position in the Entire GUI Window.
- **pack()** : Used for placing at the position after the earlier widget.
- **grid()** : It is used for placing the elements in the format of grid view or grid structure.

## Place() Method - Geometry Management

The Place geometry manager is the simplest of the three general geometry managers provided in Tkinter. It allows you explicitly set the position and size of a window, either in absolute terms, or relative to another window. You can access the place manager through the place() method which is available for all standard widgets.

It is usually not a good idea to use place() for ordinary window and dialog layouts; its simply too much work to get things working as they should. Use the pack() or grid() managers for such purposes.

*Syntax Code :*

```python
# First Method for placement of Widgets or Elements
# Using relx and relx in place() method
lb1 = tk.Label(w1,text = 'This is a simple label',font = ('Fira Code',10))                  # Lable Initiated
lb1.place(relx = 0.5,rely = 0.5,anchor = tk.CENTER)                                         # Lable Placed

# Second Method for placement of Widget inside Frame
btn1 = tk.Button(w1,text = 'Close Window',command = w1.destroy)                             # Button Created
btn1.place(x = 10,y = 5)                                                                    # Button Placed

# Third Method for placement of Widgets
btn2 = tk1.Button(w1,text = 'Another Button')
btn2.place(anchor = 'nw')

# Another Button for btn2 proper placement
btn3 = tk.Button(w1,text = 'Click Me !')
btn3.place(in_ = btn2,relx = 0.5,rely = 0.5,anchor = 'center')
